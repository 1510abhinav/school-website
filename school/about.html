<p><b>
	Write up goals, requirements and roles
</b>
</p>
<p>
	The task of creating/redesigning a new website is a multi-faceted one that requires collaboration across many school managers and departments: communications, IT, administration  some schools even have dedicated webmasters. Riding herd on the process can be a challenge, which is why it important you steer the project with clearly defined requirements, goals and roles.
</p>
<p><b>Create a website site map</b></p>
<p>
	A well-organized website is the most important factor of usability. Your sitemap is that diagram that shows the structure of all the pages in your website. It really your fundamental design tool, for at this stage in your planning is when you testing the logic and order of your pages, and doing it in a way to visualize how useable or accessible they will be.
</p>
<p><b> Create a list of school websites you love</b></p>
<p>
	As Picasso was to have said, Good artists copy, great artists steal. We often get comments like, we want our new website to look just like this school or that school. While we don condone copying or stealing website designs from others, keep your eyes open for great websites that can inspire your own design.
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		 Gather your assets
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Photos here, photos there. They can be, and probably are anywhere and everywhere: hard drives, phones, thumb drives, digital cameras, email attachments, etc. Same goes for video and audio clips. With visual appeal being a very powerful component to your websiteâ€™s success, you need to get organized and get smart about managing your digital assets. Having all your digital assets assembled will help spur the creativity and identify what content areas you need to bolster with new images.
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Plan for ADA compliancy
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Inclusion is and should be a hot button for any school, so be certain your website is accessible for all. This goes for ADA (American Disabilities Act) compliance, and other federal requirements that insure your website features inclusive design for all your users.
	</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Determine integration requirements
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	There a move afoot for schools to bring all their digital communications together to simplify administration and control, while making it easier on all your users . Many schools are looking to the simplicity of Single Sign-On to make accessing all the critical school data much less daunting and more approachable for parents, staff and students.
